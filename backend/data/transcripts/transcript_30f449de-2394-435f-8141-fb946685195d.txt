A: The Joe Rogan experience.
B: You know, I'm one of the people that has gone along to a lot of protests. There's a lot of wild people there.
A: Oh, yeah, you've done some great interviews at those protests. Yeah. It's just when they're confronted with a person who's actually asking them questions, it's remarkable how few people know why they're there. They don't know. Like, when you get into specifics, this guy did this thing today where he was talking with people at the. No, Kingspear. I'm send it to you, Jamie, because it's. It's. It's. You know, I mean, I understand why they responded the way they did, but. But it is absolutely fascinating to watch because it just shows you what. Let me find this real quick. It just shows you how much these things that people get involved in aren't bait. Oh, this ain't it. Hold on. I hate when I do this. I thought I saved it. I might not have saved it. Damn. Oh, I did save it. No, I might not have.
C: I'm sorry.
A: Sorry. No, I don't think I did. So anyway, this guy was. He was interviewing people and he was like, is this. This is about human rights? And they're like, yeah, like, are you guys, like, fully in supportive of human rights? See if you can find this guy. He's got a beard and long hair. And they're like, yes, absolutely. He goes, what about four fetuses in the womb? Everybody walk away. Everybody was like, yeah, that's unhuman. Or that I don't. And he does it to everybody. And he looks like a hippie, you know, so he's like, so you guys are for sure for human rights? And like, oh, yeah, human rights is why we're here. You believe in human rights for everyone? Yes. What about unborn babies? And you see this look on the. It's almost like everybody's under a spell.
C: Yeah.
A: Like some evil.
B: They are under a spell.
A: Yes. This is the guy. Yeah, this is him. This is him. Check this out. This is wonderful. I love when people do things like this. Can you refresh? Yeah, I just did. Yeah.
D: We'Re in favor of them for everybody?
A: Yes.
D: How about the unborn?
A: Yes, of course.
D: For everybody.
A: Yes, of course.
D: Even people in the womb?
B: Well, it all depends on if they're.
A: Actually a baby or not.
D: Science says they are.
A: Well, it depends on what science you're talking about.
D: 96% of all biologists, according to the NIH. Thoughts on human rights?
A: I'm all for them. Yeah.
D: Me too.
B: Especially now, right?
D: For everybody, Right? Yeah. Even the unborn.
A: An unborn what?
D: Unborn in the womb.
A: Yeah.
D: No rights for them. Thoughts on human rights?
A: That's what we're here for.
D: For everybody, right?
C: Yes.
D: Including the unborn.
B: No.
D: Everyone has autonomy to not feel anything.
A: He's like, nothing. Stop taking rights away. Get out of here. Nazi lives don't matter. It says on that guy's shirt that's just screaming. Yeah, Nazi lives don't matter. Who's that guy? Give him some props. What is the channel? The survivors. Us. That's him.
B: J Owl.
C: Yeah.
A: R O W L. He only has 704 followers. That's outrageous.
B: He's going to have a few more now.
A: He'll have more now. That was very fun.
B: I mean, that guy's nodding along. You can see he's, like, ready for the next yes. I think he's. No.
A: It's so weird. That's such a good trick. It's such a good trick. But it's so weird. It's so weird to watch this, like, ideological boundary, like, nope, no nuance there. No room for nuance.
B: And I don't remember if you played this when we were here last. I went to a pro Palestine protest and there was, you know, there's a lot of people there. Some of them are interesting and make good points. But there was this group of six young kids, and I walked up to them and they had the sign which says something, something socialist Intifada. And I was like, I don't know what socialist intifada means. So I said, what does that mean? And he was like, sorry, if I'm being honest. I picked up the sign over there and I went, do any of you know what intifada means? And none of them. And Intifada is an armed uprising. That's what it means. Right.
A: What do you think, like, AI defines socialists intifada as.
B: Let's Google it.
C: Depends what AI you ask, Jon.
A: Well, let's ask Perplexity. Perplexity is one of our sponsors. Let's see what socialist.
B: How smooth was that?
A: I really want to know, like, what AI would say. Like, that sounds preposterous.
C: Yeah.
A: I want to know how AI would describe that.
C: Yeah. Because sometimes Chat GPT it just. You ask them these questions and when. Well, you know, it depends who you are. Some people might. Yeah. Some people might say that it's an uprising, and others might see it as blah, blah, blah. And you're like, yeah.
A: How does perplexity define it, Jamie? How do you define Socialist intifada.
B: Int I fada.
C: You see, we're in Britain, we know how to spell that word.
A: Yeah, that word doesn't get. Doesn't get chucked around a lot out here.
C: Every day we come out, it's the intifada. It's like, course it is. You know what I mean?
A: People hear about it on Twitter and they go, I don't know what they're talking about. They just scroll down.
C: Come to Britain, you'll find out, my friend.
A: What do we got.
D: Here?
A: It is. Socialist intifada combines two distinct ideas. The Arabic concept of intifada. Intifada and the political ideology of socialism. So the meaning of intifada means shaking off or uprising in Arabic and historically refers to popular resistance movements, particularly the Palestinian uprising against Israel occupation in 1987 and 2000. It denotes collective rebellion often led by the oppressed, using acts of protest, civil disobedience and sometimes violence to resist injustice and occupation. Interesting. Also often led by the oppressed is interesting.
B: It's an interesting addition, isn't it?
A: Yeah, it's an interesting addition. It seems like that's human. That's a human addition to this thing, you know. Socialist. Socialist intifada refers to the framing of the uprising not merely as a national liberation struggle, but as a class based social revolution. Marxists and socialist movements view such an intifada as a mass movement of workers and a youth using class struggle methods. Send in the tsunami right now. Send in the tsunami and make people live off fish that they have to catch for just a month and all this shit goes away. Just give me something. Yeah, give me a small asteroid. Give me something. Give me something. Give me an alien invasion. Just give me something to shake these kids by the collar and go, shut the fuck. Just shut the fuck up and live your life. You're not living your life and you're fucking up everybody else's lives.
C: But you know, we also have to take responsibility for this. The adults, the people, the colleges, all those people need to take responsibility. So I did. I went to a Palestine protest at UCLA last year in May time, and there were. I thought it was run by the kids. There were a lot of adults there who weren't students at ucla. And the kids, when they saw some of the kids, when they saw what I was doing and I was doing interviews, they were like, he doesn't go to my college. He doesn't go to my college. He doesn't go to my college. That dude's in his early 50s, he's not on the faculty Staff. What is he doing here?
A: Yeah, they're being paid. They're part of an ngo. They're out of something. They're part of something that's decided that this is a good idea to get these students to be engaged in these things and it's funded. That's what's weird.
B: When I went to, we had protests, I'm sure you saw, which were about illegal immigration. People would protest outside of like illegal immigrant hotels where they're kept. And you had protesters and counter protests. One thing I noticed is like all the pro immigration protesters, they all have like professionally made signs. It's all organized.
A: No misspellings.
B: No. And when you dig, when you dig deep, it's organized by all these very well named organizations, you know, stand up to racism or whatever. And then you dig deeper and it's the Revolutionary Socialist Workers Party or whatever behind it.
A: And this is all the stuff that Mike Benz covered. A lot of that stuff's being funded by USAID rep. Paulina Luna. You know you had her on recently, right? Fascinating. Just her telling me about the Book of Enoch and alien stuff. That's why I had her on. Like, she believes in angels. She had like a diagram of angels that she put up on her Twitter. I'm like, this lady went to. This might be fun. But she posted something on her Twitter yesterday that shows all the people that donated to the no Kings protest and the number of corporations that donated and how much money's involved in it. It's bananas.
B: Yeah.
A: If she's accurate, if what she's saying is true, it's like, this is crazy.
B: And the leverage you get now is so easy. You don't actually need a lot. Like, for example, do you know a group called Extinction Rebellion? Are you familiar with this?
A: No.
B: So this is in. We have this in Europe. Mostly you guys don't have it here because you're like, we're going to burn all the gas we want. Right. But in Europe, obviously, climate is like a massive issue net zero, et cetera, which is, I think, a terrible idea. But anyway, we have this movement called Extinction Rebellion. I went to one of their protests. There was literally 40 people there. But if you have a protest with 40 people and you film it and you put it on social media, no one can know it's 40 people.
C: Right?
A: You just hear a lot of noise and see people and you go, oh my God, there's a protest. People are outraged.
B: Yeah, people are outraged. This is a big movement, you know, the public, really, and all this other stuff. So the Leverage you can get with a very, very small amount of money and a small number of young, impressionable people is powerful. And then it goes on social media where it's stripped of the context and suddenly we all believe this thing is real.
A: Right.
B: When it's 40 people.
A: And then when you also have to take into account, if you go into a room with a hundred people, at least one of them is a fucking idiot. Okay? So if you're being really generous.
C: Yeah, yeah.
A: So if you're in a country of 300, what, 30 plus million people, we don't really know, that's at least 3 million idiots. So it's not hard to get 100,000 retards holding signs walking down the street. And especially when they get older, because as people get older, they generally slow down and they don't think as well. And if you look at a lot of these no Kings protests, what are you seeing? You're seeing geriatric people holding signs. So you got old losers. Not even just losers, but old losers where this is the end of. They're just looking for anything to get them out of the house. They're watching the prices, right? They've already seen that one. And they're like, let's just join in on the note with their, we shouldn't have a king. And then next thing you know, they're out there with the sign.
C: Yeah.
A: And you can get a hundred thousand of those. Easy, easy, easy. Especially if you got a lot of money and you're organizing and, you know, you get on Facebook and get involved in them groups and you, you know, use the bots and all the bots. Like, this is important that we show up in mass and let him know he's not a king.
C: And it's also as well, you know, what I find really fascinating from a psychological perspective is the use of chance in that you go to these protests, you watch, and it's all about chanting and you. And what's so powerful is the chance rhyme and that, you know, it almost becomes musical and the crowd just gets whipped up in the fervor of the chance. But you look at what the chants actually mean, and most of the times they're utterly nonsensical. Like there was one which was, we won't be free until Palestine is free. And you go, what does that actually mean? What does that actually. Are you not free? I think this is a. I mean, not in the uk, but I mean, here in the US you're pretty free. Do you know what I mean? And the fact that you Then.
A: But.
C: But they would argue that. But then the moment you drill down, you actually go to them, like, what does that mean? Like, socialist intifada. The reality is they just can't. They can't explain because It's a chance.
A: 1. You got to give them credit. One thing about the geriatrics is they don't get violent like this protest. Well, they kill each other every now and then, but there was no violence. And a lot of people, which is pretty good.
B: That's great.
A: That's a good sign. That's great.
B: And look, people in a free country should be able to protest 100%.
A: The problem is, if you're organizing a protest and paying people to protest, and if there's documentation that the metadata from the cell phones are the same from protest to protest, and that they're traveling on buses, that's paid for with tax dollars, like, what are you really doing? What are you really doing? This isn't really an organic protest funneled money through an ngo. And now you're hiring people to show up and wave signs to give the illusion, look, this is what they did during the Kamala Harris campaign. They filled up stadiums with people coming to see her. And the same people went from stadium to stadium. It became a job. It became a job, but it gave the illusion. So that's deceptive. That's deception, and that should not be legal. That should not be a legal thing to do. You're engaging in propaganda. You know, you're. You're openly manipulating people's perspective. You know, you're paying. These are. Those aren't audience members. Those are clients. Those are customers. You're paying them.
C: Yeah.
B: And what. What, what is your take? What is it that they want when they say no kings? They. They. What do they want?
A: They think Donald Trump is behaving like a king.
B: How so?
A: Because, well, he ran on a platform and was elected and won every swing state and the popular vote. And then once he got in, he did exactly what he said he was gonna do, which is exactly what a king does. And then he let them protest, which is also what a king does.
C: Right? Yeah.
A: Like, no, no, he didn't send the troops to stop the protests. In fact, he congratulated them on doing a great job. And he said, I'm still your president.
C: Yeah, I saw.
A: That tweet's fucking hilarious. Yeah, it's very funny. It's a very pull up. Is that tweet that he mean? I guess it's not a tweet. It's like. Which I still say tweet. I tried.
B: It's a trickster.
A: I tried X for a while. I can't say it. I say Twitter, it's still a tweet. I might say X. But you tweeted.
B: That's right.
A: You know, and if it's truth social, it's gonna make its way to Twitter and then it's a tweet.
B: Yeah.
A: It's like you can't retrue something that doesn't make any sense.
C: You know, the thing that we have in this country, I don't know if you have it in this country as much, is just the. But the way the policing is biased, the way that they will arrest Graham Linehan for three relatively innocuous tweets. One of them was a joke. And they will arrest him the moment he lands on British soil. Five police officers. You get other people saying heinous things, or you get, like I said, the example, Zara Sultana saying, you know, we're going to fight them in the streets, but that's fine. Right. And nothing comes from that.
